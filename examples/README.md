# Example parameters

This area reflects the structure of the expected tree.

Where a `*.json` file resides in examples you will find a corresponding folder here containing the
unpacked result for executing the relevant workflow with that json example.

e.g.

`examples/cgpwxs/bam_bai.json` generates `result_WXS_bam_bai.tar.gz`, the content of which can be
compared to `expected/cgpwxs/bam_bai`.
